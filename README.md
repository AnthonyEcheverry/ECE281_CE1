# Analysis of Waveform

  The waveform that was created for this project is a visual representation of the truth table shown above.  This waveform has three inputs - "A,B,C" and one output - "F" that are represented by the "on/off" chart to the right of the inputs and output.  When they are "True" they will be displayed by the there being a box instead of a line on the chart.  A "1" or "0" will also be displayed to right next to the variables.  The variables change every  100ms as shown by the graph.
